Vertigo: The Brink of Madness is an arcade/action game of steering a probe away
from danger.

**STATUS: PRE-ALPHA**

## New stuff

**Engine changes**

The biggest feature to be introduced in this remake of the game is modding support
via Lua. The game engine will provide comprehensive modding support which will allow
mods to utilize the graphics, UI, audio, physics, and resource engines. The main gameplay
itself will be implemented as a mod (yeah!).

**Gameplay changes**

1. Power-ups
1. Massive weaponry and defensive systems for use in critical moments
1. Navigation is re-visited; tunnels will no longer be linear, movement will be
   required not only for avoiding drones but also for navigation
1. Scoring system

**Misc**

Another important improvement is that the game will be fully GPL-compliant which
will make it eligible for listing in the official Debian game repository as well
as Arch's.

## Installation

Vertigo: BoM will be released exclusively for Linux. I will personally maintain
it on the x64 arch of the following distributions: Arch Linux, Debian, and Ubuntu.
